/* O(V2)
Step 1: Determine an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex of the MST.
Step 2: Follow steps 3 to 5 till there are vertices that are not included in the MST (known as fringe vertex).
Step 3: Find edges connecting any tree vertex with the fringe vertices.
Step 4: Find the minimum among these edges.
Step 5: Add the chosen edge to the MST if it does not form any cycle.
Step 6: Return the MST and exit

Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. 
Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign the key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. 
While mstSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices 
Pick a vertex u that is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. 
Include u in the mstSet. 
Update the key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. 
For every adjacent vertex v, if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as the weight of u-v.

We sort the list on the basis of lowest weight.
We create priority queue and push the first vertex and its weight in the queue
